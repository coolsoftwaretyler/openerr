# Colorado Openerr 

[Colorado Openerr](https://twitter.com/openerr_co) uses the [Open States API](https://openstates.org/) to tweet about what is happening in Colorado state legislation. 

Built by [Ogden Studios](https://ogdenstudios.xyz). The best way to support this project is by giving money to [Open States](https://openstates.org/). 

I run the script on a VPS with more of my open source projects. That server costs about $8/month. If you want to help with that, consider [buying me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/ogdenstudios).
